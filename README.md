# Character-Drawing-Prompt
This was just a quick Java program I made that provides character drawing prompts based around five ranks (king, queen, knight, wizard, and knave) with different suits attached to them. As you go through the different suits, you will notice that some of them are very similar, almost to the point of being duplicates. However, this was intentional as it helps challenge my brain to come up with more distinct ways or different designs for characters with similar themes.

To use, copy the Prompt.java file into a folder of your choosing (C:/Users/Reciticus/Downloads/). Open a Terminal/Command Prompt application and `cd` to that file location (e.g. `cd C:/Users/Reciticus/Downloads/`). Then type in `java Prompt.java` and hit enter. You should then receive your drawing prompt!
